Operator Overloading :
	- Compile Time Polymorphism
	- Overloads the operator
	- To provide the special meaning to user defined data type

Can't overload this operators :
	- sizeof operator
	- Scope resolution operator  (::)
	- Member function selector (.) 
	- pointer structure operator (->) OR ( * )
	- Ternary operator (?:)
Rules :
	- We can overload the operators with OBJECTS only.
	
Types :
	- Unary Operator ( uses one operand only)
	- Binary Operator (uses two operands)

Benefits :
	- To perform different operations on the same operand.
